## Introduction

This repository implements meta-transformer models for behavior recognition, allowing users to leverage powerful transformer architectures to analyze and classify human behaviors. The modular design enables easy integration into different projects and datasets.

## **Installation**

To get started, follow these steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MetaTransformer-Behavior-Recognition.git
```
```
cd MetaTransformer-Behavior-Recognition
```
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Usage**

The repository provides examples and scripts for using the meta-transformer models. Customize the configurations, input paths, and parameters as needed for your specific use case.


```
python main.py 
```

## **Dataset**
